Impossible Jetpack is a highly addictive game where you have to collect all the green gems in the space, while you avoid colliding with the asteroids. This game is made in Java using Android Studio since Google is not supporting Eclipse anymore (you can import on Eclipse). The game has been made using LibGDX and box2D framework which is also made in pure java.
